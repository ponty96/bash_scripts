# DiArY
Hi there, and welcome to my **diary** where I'll make best effort to share my
learnings on different technologies and tools progressively.

It's still pretty empty so far, but I'll try to ramp up content - new or from my
drafts.

I hope this is an opportunity to share my incomplete drafts until I have
sufficient time, and mental bandwidth to start a proper technical blog.

Feel free to reach out to me with comment, questions and/or feedback at `ayo dot aregbede at gmail dot com`.

## Upcoming Adventures

**Wish me luck! 🙏🏾😅**

* [bash]🐚 Improve & update the UX of [release_memory](./bash/release_memory.sh).

The goal would be to make it a process inspection tool with a better UX using
[gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) and
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). Basically, allow myself inspect each
process - interactively ask for information about each process like CPU, parent
process, memory, file descriptors e.t.c, and send signals to each process.

* [rust]🦀 A rust version of [Confd](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd)
It will be my first official Rust OS project. I do not process to make it as
comprehensive or production ready, but as close as possible.

* [nix] Dev environment setup. I will try to make the audacious attempt to move
my development environment to Nix/NixOS, completely removing Docker.



**Every "project" is an adventure; some I'll complete, others I won't. It's
life**
